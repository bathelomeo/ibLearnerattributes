        <h3><em>Learner Profiles</em></h3>
    <p>
       <em>
        in my school they are learner profiles.
        such as:
        inquirers.
        knowledgeable.
        thinkers.
        communicators.
        principled.
        open minded
        caring.
        courageous.
        balanced.
        reflective.
        leaader.
        steward.
        The organisation's name and logo were changed in 2007 to reflect new structural arrangements. 
        Consequently, "IB" may now refer to the organisation itself, any of the four programmes, or the diploma or certificates awarded at the end of a programme.
        When Marie-Thérèse Maurette wrote "Educational Techniques for Peace. Do They Exist?" in 1948,[5] she created the framework for what would eventually become the IB Diploma Programme (IBDP).
        In the mid-1960s, a group of teachers from the International School of Geneva (Ecolint) created the International Schools Examinations Syndicate (ISES), which would later become the International Baccalaureate Office (IBO), followed by the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) and then the International Baccalaureate (IB).
